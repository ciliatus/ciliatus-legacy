# Ciliatus
Ciliatus is an open source intelligent solution to automate your terrarium.

With a realtime dashboard you are always up to date with the current state of your terraria's vitals and get notified in case the thresholds you defined are being breached.

A fully fleshed REST API allows you to feed ciliatus with sensor readings. An example can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/matthenning/ciliatus_controlunit).

The frontend was built using Google's material design guidelines and will give you an easy start without having to read pages of documentation.
